# This is a nested dictionary of settings changes for each scenario defined in the
# "scenario_definitions_fn" file.
# - The fist set of keys are planning years.
# - The second set of keys are either "all_cases" or the name of a scenario in the
# "scenario_definitions_fn" file. If "all_cases" then the settings key: value will be
# applied to all settings files for that year. An example scenario might be "ccs_capex".
# - The third set of keys are names of scenario values. For a "ccs_capex" scenario these
# might be "high", "mid", "low".
# - The values under this third set of keys are a key: value pair where the key is a
# parameter from this settings file with a value that should be modified for a specific
# case.
